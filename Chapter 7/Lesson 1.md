### Understanding Complex Contract Implementations
In this chapter, we'll dive deeper into more complex TON smartcontracts, with a special focus on Jettons and NFTs.

In the world of TON, everything is spinning around contracts. Whether it's a wallet, an arbitrary logic of smartcontract or known Jettons and NFTs - they all are essentially smart-contracts.

For the ecosystem to function seamlessly, it's crucial that these smart contracts adhere to certain standards. This ensures that everyone knows how to interact with acertain entity, for example Jettons or NFTs. The community has come together to agree upon these standards, ensuring that Jettons and NFTs are treated in a universally accepted manner.

We'll be taking a closer look at a repository that houses all these agreed-upon standards. This will give us insights into how the community perceives and interacts with these entities.

### The Code Behind the Standards
While standards lay out the requirements and expected behaviors of contracts, there are also standard implementations that developers can refer to. These implementations are essentially pre-published contracts that embody the best practices of the standard. Both Jettons and NFTs have such reference implementations.

It's essential to note that the logic isn't confined to a single contract. For instance, for Jettons, there's more than one contract to consider. You have a master contract and a wallet contract. Similarly, for NFTs, there's a collection contract and an item contract. In our subsequent lessons, we'll unpack the logic behind these contracts, exploring how they function, interact, and the role they play in the broader ecosystem.

By understanding these standard implementations, you'll gain a deeper knowledge of the standards as well as FunC capabilities. This knowledge will be invaluable when you embark on writing your own contracts.

Stay tuned for our next lesson where we'll dive even deeper!
